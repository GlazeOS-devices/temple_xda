[B]Linaro Optimized[/B]
Linaro’s GCC improvements have been producing measurable performance advantages over Google’s stock Android environment and build toolchain, delivering an improvement of 30 to 100 percent in various benchmarks.

The Android for MSM project allows users to build an Android based platform containing additional enhancements for Qualcomm chipsets. The platform uses Google's Android Linux implementation and tools.
